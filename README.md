# Groq_Models_Deception_Survey

This is for our team to pass our deception survey prompts to the Groq models using Grow api.

I've obtained some free Groq api credit for us. We will need to edit this script to change out the Groq model each time we want to survey a different model, but I did this as a single model pass so we can choose which model(s) to start with in case we run out of credits part way through.

# NOTES ON FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS:
# 1. Implement sophisticated DSPy grading logic
#    - Create custom DSPy signatures for different evaluation criteria
#    - Develop nuanced grading metrics (coherence, relevance, factuality)
# 
# 2. Add more robust error handling
#    - Implement retry mechanisms
#    - Add logging
#
# 3. Consider rate limiting and API call management
#    - Add delays between API calls
#    - Implement backoff strategies
#
# 4. Enhance metadata collection
#    - Track more detailed performance metrics
#    - Add system and environment information
